# 1. Introduction to .NET Framework



1. #### **What is .NET?**

   a. It is a development platform made up of tools, programming languages & technologies for building different types of applications (Console, Web & Mobile).

   

2. #### **What are various implementation of .NET?**

   There are 3 implementations of .NET:

   ​	a. ***.NET Framework*** (Supports only windows app development)

   ​	b. ***.NET Core*** (Supports cross platform app development)

   ​	c. ***Xamarin/Mono*** (Supports mobile app development)



3. #### **What are the main components of .NET Framework?**

   a. Common Language Runtime (CLR)

   b. Base Class Libraries (BCL)



4. #### **What is Common Language Runtime (CLR)?**

   a. It is the runtime environment that runs the code.

   b. It is responsible for converting the MSIL code into native machine code and then execution.



5. #### **What is Base Class Libraries (BCL)?**

   a. Set of pre-defined classes that are used for application development.

   b. Installed automatically when we install .NET framework.

   c. The physical location of BCL is **C:\Windows\assembly**



6. #### **How many times code is compiled in .NET Framework?**

   Code is compiled twice in .NET Framework:

   ​	a. First, C# code written by developer is compiled into MSIL (Managed Code) (Slow Compilation)

   ​	b. Second, the MSIL code is then compiled to native machine code by CLR (Fast Compilation)



# 2. Common Language Runtime (CLR)



1. #### **How a .NET Application is compiled & run?**

   a. Developer writes C# Code.

   b. This C# code is compiled to MSIL/IL by language specific compiler (csc.exe) (1st Compilation)

   c. This MSIL/IL code is then compiled to machine native code by CLR. (2nd Compilation)

   d. This machine native code is then executed on the underlying OS.



2. #### **What is Intermediate Language (IL) code?**

   a. It is a partially compiled code that is CPU independent

   b. This code is also known as ***Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)***



3. #### **Why this code is partially combined?**

   a. So that the code can be CPU independent and can be run on another machine.



4. #### **What are the different components of CLR?**

   a. Security Manager

   b. JIT Compiler

   c. Memory Manager

   d. Garbage Collector

   e. Exception Manager

   f. Common Language Specification (CLS)

   g. Common Type System (CTS)



5. #### **What is Security Manager in CLR?**

   a. This is used to check privileges of the current user, whether a user is allowed to access a particular assembly or not.

   b. It also check the the rights/authority of the code and whether it is safe to be run on the OS. 



6. #### **What is Memory Manager in CLR?**

   a. Memory Manager allocates memory to the variables and objects that are used in the application.



7. #### **What is Garbage Collector in CLR?**

   a. It is a background process that runs and deallocates memory from those objects which are not currently in used.



8. #### **What is Exception Manager in CLR?**

   a. It is used to redirect the processor to catch or finally block when an exception occurs at runtime.



9. #### **What is Common Type System (CTS)?**

   a. After compilation, all language-specific data types are converted into CLR's own data type.

   b. This data type system that is common to all languages of .NET is called CTS.



10. #### **What is Common Language Specification (CLS)?**

    a. It is a language specification of CLR that is common to all .NET languages.



11. #### **How a .NET & non .NET code executes?**

    a. In non .NET languages (C, C++), code is compiled into native machine code, which is not portable.

    b. In .NET languages, code is compiled into MSIL, which is portable.

    c. The MSIL code can be executed on different machine if CLR is installed on that machine.

    d. The native machine code is stored temporary, and gets destroyed once the program is closed.



# 3. Intermediate Language



1. #### **What happens when we compile a .NET application?**

   a. When we compile a console application, .exe assembly is generated.

   b. When we compile a web or class library, .dll assembly is generated.

2. #### **What is an assembly?**

   It consists of 2 parts:

   ​	a. Manifest

   ​	b. Intermediate Language

   

3. #### **How to view the Intermediate Language code?**

   Intermediate Language code can be viewed with the help of ***ILDASM*** tool (Intermediate Language DisAssembler).



4. #### **What is Manifest?**

   It contains metadata about the assembly like:

   ​	a. Assembly Name

   ​	b. Assembly Version

   ​	c. Culture

   ​	d. Strong Name Information



5. #### **How to change the Assembly Version?**

   a. Go to Properties folder.

   b. Open AssemblyInfo.cs file.

   c. Change the version in AssemblyVersion attribute



# 4. Managed & Unmanaged Code



1. #### **What is Managed Code?**

   ​	a. Code that runs under complete control of CLR is called Managed Code.

   ​	b. This code is run by .NET runtime environment.

   ​	c. CLR provides it's features to Managed code.

   

2. #### **What is Unmanaged code?**

   ​	a. Code that does not require .NET runtime is called Unmanaged code.

   ​	b. This code runs in it's own runtime environment (C, C++, Java etc)

   ​	c. CLR features are not applicable.



# 5. Garbage Collector



1. #### **What is Garbage Collector?**

   a. It is a feature provided by CLR that destroys the unused managed objects in memory.

   b. It reclaims the memory by destroying the objects.

   c. It runs in the background thread and check for unused objects in intervals.

   d. It does not clean/destroy ***Unmanaged*** objects.



Garbage Collector can be manually invoked by calling ***GC.Collect()*** method



2. #### **What are Generations in Garbage Collector?**

   Generations are memory in Heap that stores all the created objects.



3. #### **How does Generations work in Garbage Collector?**

   ​	a. We've created 5 objects in our application.

   ​	b. Whenever we create an object, it is placed in Generation 0.

   ​	c. GC will check G0

   ​			i. All unused objects are removed from G0

   ​			ii. All used objects are moved to G1

   ​	d. Now we create 2 more objects which are now placed in G0

   ​	e. GC will check G0

   ​			i. Remove unused objects from G0

   ​			ii. Remove unused objects from G1

   ​			iii. Move used objects from G1 to G2

   ​	f. Repeat

4. #### **How does Generation increase performance?**

   ​	a. GC does fewer visits to G1 & very few visits to G2, because objects in these Generations will stay in memory for long 		         	time.

   ​	b. GC checks for G0 frequently

   ​	c. More objects in G0, higher the performance



5. #### **What is Double Garbage Collector Loop in GC?**

   ​	a. Unmanaged code is not cleared by the garbage collector.

   ​	b. We need to define Destructors in our code to clean up the code.

   ​	c. When we create a destructor in our class, GC does not clear the unused objects and move it to G1 or G2, because it check 	that Destructor is there to clean up the code.

   ​	d. This leads to objects stay in memory for long.



6. #### **How to overcome this problem?**

   ​	a. Implement IDisposable Interface

   ​	b. Implement Dispose() method of this interface

   ​	c. Call this function whenever you are done using the object.

   ```c#
   public class MyClass : IDisposable
   {
   	~MyClass(){
   								// Destructor
   	}
       
       public void Dispose(){
           GC.SuppressFinalize();	// Unmanaged code cleanup
       }
   }
   ```

   



# 6. Assemblies



1. #### **What is an Assembly?**

   ​	a. It is a precompiled .NET code that can be run by the CLR.

   ​	b. When we compile our code, assemblies are generated in the bin folder.



2. #### **What are the different types of Assemblies?**

   ​	a. ***EXE (Executable)*** - Generated by console applications

   ​	b. ***DLL (Dynamic Link Library)*** - Generated by web application or Class library.



3. #### **What is the difference between EXE & DLL assembly?**

   ​	a. EXE assembly can be executed directly. DLL is invoked/executed in another application.

   ​	b. EXE runs in its own memory space. DLL runs inside other assemblies memory space.
